excerpt: "Next.js pairs a great developer experience with performance, SEO, and serverless APIsâ€”ideal for AI-powered apps."

Next.js combines **server components**, **API routes**, and **edge rendering**. For AI products this means:

- Render fast with cached UI and stream model responses.
- Host lightweight APIs for model orchestration.
- Secure secrets server-side (keys, webhooks).

Pair it with **vector databases** for retrieval and a queue worker for long-running jobs (transcription, fine-tuning).
