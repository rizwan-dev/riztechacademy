**AI is no longer optional** for venture-backed startups. The winners use AI to compress time-to-value and differentiate their product experience.

## 1) Make it measurable
Pick a north-star metric (activation, retention, or revenue). Prototype quickly and measure deltas with A/B tests or cohort analysis.

## 2) Focus on workflows, not just chat
Useful assistants do more than answer questions. Give them tools (APIs/SQL/CRM) and guardrails. Instrument usage.

## 3) Own your data advantage
Capture domain data (tickets, calls, docs) in a privacy-safe way. Use retrieval (RAG) and evals to keep responses grounded.

> Tip: Start simple, ship fast, iterate weekly.
